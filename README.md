# HolidayTerm
A program to show a message for the next Holiday 

Requires the calendar (not cal)  program to be installed (installed in most Linux/MacOS by default) 

currently uses non-portable date math, so only works on Linux. 

By default uses calendars.usholidays which has the majority of the holidays celebrated in the US
